# SysAPI
System level APIs for easy systems programming

This repo is a test / learning set of examples or API which guide to
easier and quicker systems programming in Linux.

The library only uses pthreads (the pthread support can be hidden via a
macro but that disables the event looping).

When you are using this library use it with ``` -lsysapi ``` and ``` -pthread``` option.
