This is what i can think of this time.. more to go when i read more and more useful linux programming stuff..


1. provide CSV based file reading API
2. provide a way to log to shared memory
    1. log when asked
    2. dump when needed
    3. tail -f dump facility
3. provide utility API to log to syslog
4. provide utility for logging on the console (in case of errors)
5. sharedmemory based message passing (socket + shm)
